I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at the Institute for [Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/Yao_Class/About_Yao_Class.htm), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). Currently, I am interested in algorithms, in particular graph algorithms and data structures.

During the spring and summer of 2025, I had a wonderful visit to Carnegie Mellon University as a student intern, where I worked with [Prof. Jason Li](https://q3r.github.io).
